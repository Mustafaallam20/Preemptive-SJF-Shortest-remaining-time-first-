# Preemptive-SJF-Shortest-remaining-time-first-
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the enahnced version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job that is closest to completion. This algorithm requires adavnced knowledge and concept of CPU. It is adventageous because short processes are handled very quickly. Here SRTF is implemented using C++.
